# ADCTest

As of October 2024 this software project is no longer being actively developed at the Library of Congress. ADCTest was created in 2017 by AVP (www.weareavp.com), and developed by Christian Landone, for the Library of Congress and the other federal government agencies participating in the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative.
